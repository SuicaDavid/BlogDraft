# The conclusion of wordle extension development

Due to the high amount of wordle spam mess from my friend, I need some tools to reduce their interest of play Wordle. During these months, I developed a website to provide hints of possible worlds and continue to finetune the algorithm. Then, the limitation of the website is found, so I turn to build a browser extension.

## The website
The story began with a ~~incognito penguin~~ who was obsessed with Wordle. He recommended almost everyone he know to join the game and received punishment.

When the game was still fun, the word was sometimes hard so he needed to seek from the digital dictionary to guess the word. One day, he realized that the words can be filtered by the method of exhaustion. A website was developed to be released to [Vercel](https://wordle-plugin.vercel.app).

The design of this project is simple, users input the words they have inputed into the wordle website. Then, click the letter to change the color to fix its result on wordle website.

// Algorithm


// Problem
It is so cumber for the users and they absolutely don't want to use the website. For that reason, I developed this extension to force them to install. Once install forever destroy.

## The biggest problem of the extension
However, the only and the biggest problem is that I need to pay **5 dollars** for the developer fee of Google Web Store. I am currently in the condition of homeless. That reason daunts me to submit further.
